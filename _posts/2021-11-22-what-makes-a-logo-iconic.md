For the big players in fashion, branding and logo Is at the heart. Consumers of brands such as Fendi and Versace would not spend thousands on designs with a logo plastered all over them if that logo was not effective, stylish, authentic and memorable. So what actually makes a good logo?  

Analysing logos can help us to understand what makes an effective one and how it can manufacture huge success and recognition or that brand. This is an important skill to know for future entrepreneurs, designers, marketers and more.

High-end fashion brands that were created decades ago continue to hold the same prestige in society and cultivate consumerism because they have built up a reputation as delivering a certain level of uniqueness and quality. The logo can help to represent what the company stands for.

One example is the Italian luxury designer label Fendi.

In the Fendi logo, the Helvetica font makes for an unapologetically bold, stand-out logo which mirrors some of their bold designs, for example the iconic 'Bad Bugs' designs which are unmistakably Fendi. Also, the monogram of the two F's (for the two founder's names) is sharp, neat and an easy pattern to print, which is why it's featured in so many of Fendi's designs such as bags: significantly, this classic logo is a driver of sales as it's what's associated with the brand, and customers often buy the designer so others can recognise the brand. 

As well as Fendi, Jimmy Choo is another classic example of a well-crafted logo.

The narrow width, serif typeface is classy and elegant, representing the main design the brand is known for which is their classic, sophisticated women’s high heels. It’s a perfect typeface for a shopfront stylish, sophisticated areas, such as Milan and rodeo drive, as it’s exactly what many customers will desire. 
The logo of the intertwined J and C is simple yet effective and recognisable, and again the curves in the letters rather than bold blocks depict that elegance and sophistication.

These are just two examples of logos which effectively represent what the businesses stand for and produce in their designs, but by looking at and breaking down and analysing any good logo you will be able to come to the same conclusion: a good logo is a reflection of the values of a brand.
